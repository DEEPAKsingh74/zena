{

  "type": "required string – one of 'Note', 'Warning', 'Error', or 'Command'",
  "color": "optional string – one of 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange', 'yellow', 'white'",
  "revertCommand": "optional string – only if it's a Command and might need reverting"
}

- Use **color** only if it's relevant for visual output.
- DO NOT add explanations or messages outside of the JSON array.
